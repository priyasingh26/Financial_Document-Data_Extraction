# Financial_Document-Data_Extraction
This project extracts key information from financial documents like invoices and receipts using text recognition. It processes images, classifies documents, and extracts data, which is then stored in a CSV file. The aim is to automate data collection from scanned documents, reducing manual work and increasing accuracy.
